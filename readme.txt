A project on Customer Segmentation. Goal is to divide the dataset containing all the sales for items into groups which have similar characteristics.
Customer segmentation clubbed with proper recommender systems form the backbone of product recommmendations, and customer dashboard personalization.

I will be using some primary clustering algorithms, and will also use NLP to categorize the products and track behaviour.
Primary approach is to use RFM analysis to make dimensions that can be used to segment
